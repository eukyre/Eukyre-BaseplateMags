This mod adds various Magpul GEN M3 P-MAGs with coloured baseplates for easier identification when dropped or in the inventory; think mag tape, but a bit more permenant.

**THIS MOD WILL NOT LOAD WITH ECHOES OF TARKOV - REQUISITIONS AS THESE MAGS WILL BE INCLUDED THERE IN THE NEXT MAJOR UPDATE.**

Currently this mod contains:
- 5.56x45 30-Rounders in Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple, Pink, FDE, Olive Drab & White.
